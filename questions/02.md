# Mass Assignment: Keyword Arguments

Consider the following code:

```
def greeting(name, programming_language)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
  puts "Welcome to the #{programming_language} curriculum"
end

greeting(programming_language: "Ruby", name: "Leroy Jenkins")
```

What will the code sample above output?

## Correct

```
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2)
```

> Fantastic! Because we have not set up our method with keyword arguments, passing
> a Hash instead of two separate arguments will give us an argument error.

## Incorrect

```
Hello, Ruby
Welcome to the Leroy Jenkins curriculum
```

> Not quite. What would have to change about how `greeting` is invoked for the
> code to produce this output.

## Incorrect

```
Hello, Leroy Jenkins
Welcome to the Ruby curriculum
```

> Not quite. For the code to produce this output, what would need to change in the
> method declaration?

## Incorrect

I don't know
