# Mass Assignment: Keyword Arguments

We are declaring a method that needs to take five arguments. What is the best
way to declare this method?

## Correct

Define the method using keyword arguments.

> Correct! By using keyword arguments, we can associate each value with a
> meaningful key or name.

## Incorrect

Define the method using regular parameters separated with commas.

> Not quite. What happens if another dev calls the method with the arguments in
> the wrong order? As a [general rule][too many params], try to avoid defining
> more than three or four parameters for a single method.

## Incorrect

There's no benefit to choosing regular parameters or keyword arguments.

> Not quite. By using keyword arguments, we can associate each value with a
> meaningful key or name which means we don't need to worry about the order the
> arguments are passed in. As a [general rule][too many params], try to avoid
> defining more than three or four parameters for a single method.

## Incorrect

I don't know
