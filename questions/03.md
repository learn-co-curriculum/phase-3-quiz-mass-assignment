# Mass Assignment: Keyword Arguments

Consider the following code:

```rb
def greeting(name:, programming_language:)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
  puts "Welcome to the #{programming_language} curriculum"
end

greeting(name: "Leroy Jenkins", programming_language: "Ruby")
```

What will the code sample above output?

## Correct

```txt
Hello, Leroy Jenkins
Welcome to the Ruby curriculum
```

> Yes! `greeting` is using keyword arguments, so when we pass a Hash containing
> key-value pairs, it correctly maps those values to the appropriate arguments.

## Incorrect

```txt
Hello, Ruby
Welcome to the Leroy Jenkins curriculum
```

> Take a look at the method and how it's invoked. Which value will be used
> where?

## Incorrect

```txt
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2)
```

> `greeting` was declared with keyword arguments. What data type do we pass to
> methods that use keyword arguments?

## Incorrect

I don't know
