# Mass Assignment: Class Initialization

Consider the following code:

```rb
class User
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :location, :user_name

  def initialize(user_name:, name:, age:, location:)
    @user_name = user_name
    @name = name
    @location = location
    @age = age
  end
end
```

The above code snippet is considered _metaprogramming_.
