# Mass Assignment: Keyword Arguments

We want to be able to do the following:

```rb
rat_counter(rat_count: 2, train_line: "B train")
# => "There are 2 rats on the B train"
```

Which `rat_counter` method will achieve this?

## Correct

```rb
def rat_counter(rat_count:, train_line:)
  "There are #{rat_count} rats on the #{train_line}."
end
```

> Perfect! By using keyword arguments, we can pass a Hash to the method and
> return a String with all of the values in their right places.

## Incorrect

```rb
def rat_counter(rat_count, train_line)
  "There are #{rat_count} rats on the #{train_line}."
end
```

> Not quite. This method takes two separate arguments and the order of those
> arguments will matter. What changes can we make to fix this so that it takes a
> Hash when it's invoked?

## Incorrect

Either of these options will work

> Not quite. We need to set up our method to use keyword arguments in order to
> be able to pass in a Hash when it's invoked.

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
