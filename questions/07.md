# Mass Assignment: Class Initialization

```
class User
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :email

  def initialize(name, age, email)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @email = email
  end
end
```

How can we use mass assignment and metaprogramming so that both of the following
code snippets run successfully:

```
hambo = User.new(name: 'Hambo', age: 22)
puts hambo.name

jambaby = User.new(name: 'JamBaby', age: 67, email: 'jam@baby.com', title: 'Dr.')
puts jambaby.title
```

Choose the **best** option.

## Correct

```
class User
  def initialize(attributes)
    attributes.each do |key, value|
      self.class.attr_accessor(key)
      self.send("#{key}=", value)
    end
  end
end
```

> Wow!! We can dynamically add the setter and getter methods, and the values of
> the attributes by iterating through the `attributes` Hash.

## Incorrect

```
class User
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :email, :title

  def initialize(attributes)
    attributes.each do |key, value|
      self.send("#{key}=", value)
    end
  end
end
```

> Although this would work, it's not the best option in this case. This would
> require us to manually add every possible attribute when invoking
> `attr_accessor`.

## Incorrect

```
class User
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :email, :title

  def initialize(attributes)
    @name = attributes[:name]
    @age = attributes[:age]
    @email = attributes[:email]
    @title = attributes[:title]
  end
end
```

> Although this would work, it's not the best option. This would require us to
> manually add every possible attribute when invoking `attr_accessor` and inside
> `#initialize`. This code is neither flexible nor abstract.

## Incorrect

I don't know
