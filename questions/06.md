# Mass Assignment: Class Initialization

What are some of the benefits of combining metaprogramming with mass assignment
when declaring classes? Select **all** that apply.

## Correct

Our code is more flexible because it doesn't have to rely on attributes with
fixed names

> Perfect! We can map any key in a Hash, regardless of its name, to an attribute
> on an object in `#initialize`.

## Correct

We can make classes more flexible by adding any number of attributes based on
our needs at the time without editing `#initialize`

> Yes! We no longer have to rely on a fixed number of arguments to be present in
> any method.

## Correct

We can dynamically add getter and setter methods

> Amazing! Using metaprogramming, we can add as many getters and setters as there
> are keys in the Hash that's provided when an object is instantiated.

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
